Urban Terror Custom Menu by quak
Updated: 2023-09-16
Version 1.0


A new improved menu aimed at being used toghter with the jump client.
But will still work without the jump/q3e client.
Goal is to keep the menu similar to the original but fix up some small design things and add a bunch of quality of life features.

Notable fetatures:
 - Improved scoreboard (TAB)
 - Improved main menu with quick access to servers and reconnect button.
 - Server menu from ingame to quickly check other servers or connect without having to retun to the menu
 - Add most new features from the jump client into the menus
Note!:
Most new options include have addition commands related to them, like position on screen and color settings, those are not included in the menu and you would have to use the console to edit them.



Install notes:
Add pk3 to your q3ut4 folder.
